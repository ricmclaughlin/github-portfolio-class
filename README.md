# Github Portfolio Development Class


The idea behind the class is to take students who have a basic compentence in HTML & CSS with bit of commandline and JavaScript skills and teach them the basics of git, github, Jekyll and gulp.js. In addition, students get some understanding of what a development tool chain is and how to manage that tool chain on an Ubuntu workstation via the super cool [c9](https://c9.io) cloud development environment.
